            <p><i>This document is primarily aimed at signatory organizations of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/frontier-ai-safety-commitments-ai-seoul-summit-2024/frontier-ai-safety-commitments-ai-seoul-summit-2024">Frontier AI Safety Commitments</a>, though we hope that all AI developers will find this guide useful.</i></p>

            <p>The Frontier AI Safety Commitments at the AI Seoul Summit aim to ensure that frontier AI developers (1) effectively plan to responsibly manage risk from powerful AI systems, (2) develop internal structures to hold themselves accountable for safe development and deployment, and (3) make their safety plans appropriately transparent to external actors. To this end, the 16 signatory companies agreed to publish a document called a safety framework that demonstrates the fulfillment of eight specific commitments before the upcoming AI Summit in France.</p>
            
            <p>In this document, we provide a step-by-step guide to making such a safety framework. We reference the following existing safety frameworks: <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/openai-preparedness-framework-beta.pdf">OpenAI's Preparedness Framework</a>, <a href="https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/1adf000c8f675958c2ee23805d91aaade1cd4613/responsible-scaling-policy.pdf">Anthropic's Responsible Scaling Policy</a>, and <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/introducing-the-frontier-safety-framework/fsf-technical-report.pdf">Google DeepMind's Frontier Safety Framework</a>.</p>

                    <p>I. Assess the risks posed by their frontier models or systems across the AI lifecycle, including before deploying that model or system, and, as appropriate, before and during training. Risk assessments should consider model capabilities and the context in which they are developed and deployed, as well as the efficacy of implemented mitigations to reduce the risks associated with their foreseeable use and misuse. They should also consider results from internal and external evaluations as appropriate, such as by independent third-party evaluators, their home governments, and other bodies their governments deem appropriate.</p>

                    <h3>Step 1: Risk Identification</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>The commitments explicitly require consideration of <strong>Model Theft</strong> of unreleased model weights. Affirm that this risk vector will be considered.
                        <ol>
                            <li>Controls for model weights, both physical and digital, may go hand-in-hand with security controls for other sorts of intellectual property, such as codebases and algorithmic advances.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Potentially consider additional risk vectors as you see fit. This is not explicitly required by the commitments, but existing safety frameworks all consider potential risks downstream of model capabilities.
                        <ol>
                            <li>Generally, consider the range of capabilities of the model and its possible use-cases across deployment contexts. Some questions to consider:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>What hostile actors will be able to use the model? In what ways are they currently prevented from causing harm, and could the model help them overcome those?</li>
                                    <li>In the course of normal use, how could the AI system cause accidental harm to the user? What is the potential scope of this harm?</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/vERGLBpDE8m5mpT6t/autonomous-replication-and-adaptation-an-attempt-at-a"><strong>Autonomy</strong>, <strong>ML R&D</strong></a>, <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2024/06/project-naptime.html"><strong>Cyber Offense</strong></a>, and <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2977-1.html"><strong>Bioweapons</strong></a> are currently considered risk vectors in all published safety frameworks.</li>
                            <li>This process requires judgment calls, and will vary depending on your organization.</li>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>We recommend taking into account existing practices as well as feedback from leadership, employees, and the public.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>Risk vectors are specific mechanisms by which AI systems could cause harm, and include both deliberate malicious action as well as unintended consequences. Each risk vector may require a unique approach to assessment, monitoring, and mitigation.</p>

                <p>While examining additional risk vectors can reduce the risk of a model causing harm, it also increases costs â€“ requiring additional evaluations (including potentially <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11986">more complex evaluations</a>), more mitigation steps, and a potential risk of delaying or stopping deployment. If your organization wants to consider a broader set of harms than are listed here, we recommend looking at the <a href="https://airisk.mit.edu/">AI Risk Repository</a>, which attempts to catalog many more AI harms.</p>

                                <li>For <strong>Model Theft</strong>: Red-teaming can be a way to judge security measures effectively.</li>
                                <li>For <strong>Bioweapons</strong>: Typical evaluations judge whether an AI system is better than a search engine at aiding:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Amateurs in producing known pathogens.</li>
                                        <li>Expert in producing novel pathogens.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li>For <strong>Cyber Offense</strong>: Capture-the-flag challenges are often used to estimate a system's cyberoffensive capabilities.</li>
                                <li>Justify how each assessment is relevant to real-world outcomes.
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>For example: if <strong>Cyber Offense</strong> evaluations are developed with experts to mimic real-world codebases not in the training data, an AI system's performance on the assessment represents real hacking capability.</li>
                                        <li>To ensure external validity and prevent "teaching to the test", perhaps detailed information on what is assessed should be limited even within a given organization.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li>Options exist for non-capability-based evaluations for certain risk domains. For example:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Scaling law analyses might be used to predict how <strong>Model Autonomy</strong> will increase without actually testing models.
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>However, this method may not be useful for judging <strong>Bioweapons</strong> risks, since narrow AI systems can still aid in dangerous tasks.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Analyses of the training data to detect presence of examples of dangerous capabilities could be used to filter out <strong>Bioweapons</strong>-relevant data.</li>
                                        <li>Forecasting of future capabilities can also be used to predict AI system capabilities, as mentioned in OpenAI's Preparedness Framework.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>

                               <li>For <strong>Bioweapons</strong>, the risk might be intolerable if the model would enable a PhD-level expert to synthesize a pandemic-potential pathogen with less than $100,000.</li>
                               <li>These risk-thresholds might need to be set based on the intended deployment modality. The risks associated with serving an API of a base model might be different than the risks associated with offering fine-tuning.</li>

                               <li>Perhaps as simple as cleaning up internal discussions.</li>

                       <li>For each justification above, describe in moderate detail the corresponding scenario where, if the threshold is exceeded and the risk isn't mitigated, intolerable harms can occur.</li>
                       <li>Optionally, set additional thresholds as necessary to ensure that AI systems are safely developed and deployed. These may not need to be fully fleshed out as the intolerable risk thresholds above. For example:
                           <ol>
                               <li>If some mitigations are expensive to apply, at which threshold will they start coming into practice?</li>
                               <li>Since safety mitigations such as refusals can be nearly-trivially removed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00117">adversarial fine-tuning</a>, thresholds based on the model's performance before safety mitigations may be useful to address threat models such as <strong>Model Theft</strong>.</li>
