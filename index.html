            <p><i>This document is primarily aimed at signatory organizations of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/frontier-ai-safety-commitments-ai-seoul-summit-2024/frontier-ai-safety-commitments-ai-seoul-summit-2024">Frontier AI Safety Commitments</a>, though we hope that all AI developers will find this guide useful.</i></p>

            <p>The Frontier AI Safety Commitments at the AI Seoul Summit aim to ensure that frontier AI developers (1) effectively plan to responsibly manage risk from powerful AI systems, (2) develop internal structures to hold themselves accountable for safe development and deployment, and (3) make their safety plans appropriately transparent to external actors. To this end, the 16 signatory companies agreed to publish a document called a safety framework that demonstrates the fulfillment of eight specific commitments before the upcoming AI Summit in France.</p>
            
            <p>In this document, we provide a step-by-step guide to making such a safety framework. We reference the following existing safety frameworks: <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/openai-preparedness-framework-beta.pdf">OpenAI's Preparedness Framework</a>, <a href="https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/1adf000c8f675958c2ee23805d91aaade1cd4613/responsible-scaling-policy.pdf">Anthropic's Responsible Scaling Policy</a>, and <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/introducing-the-frontier-safety-framework/fsf-technical-report.pdf">Google DeepMind's Frontier Safety Framework</a>.</p>

                    <p>I. Assess the risks posed by their frontier models or systems across the AI lifecycle, including before deploying that model or system, and, as appropriate, before and during training. Risk assessments should consider model capabilities and the context in which they are developed and deployed, as well as the efficacy of implemented mitigations to reduce the risks associated with their foreseeable use and misuse. They should also consider results from internal and external evaluations as appropriate, such as by independent third-party evaluators, their home governments, and other bodies their governments deem appropriate.</p>

                    <h3>Step 1: Risk Identification</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>The commitments explicitly require consideration of <strong>Model Theft</strong> of unreleased model weights. Affirm that this risk vector will be considered.
                        <ol>
                            <li>Controls for model weights, both physical and digital, may go hand-in-hand with security controls for other sorts of intellectual property, such as codebases and algorithmic advances.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Potentially consider additional risk vectors as you see fit. This is not explicitly required by the commitments, but existing safety frameworks all consider potential risks downstream of model capabilities.
                        <ol>
                            <li>Generally, consider the range of capabilities of the model and its possible use-cases across deployment contexts. Some questions to consider:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>What hostile actors will be able to use the model? In what ways are they currently prevented from causing harm, and could the model help them overcome those?</li>
                                    <li>In the course of normal use, how could the AI system cause accidental harm to the user? What is the potential scope of this harm?</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/vERGLBpDE8m5mpT6t/autonomous-replication-and-adaptation-an-attempt-at-a"><strong>Autonomy</strong>, <strong>ML R&D</strong></a>, <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2024/06/project-naptime.html"><strong>Cyber Offense</strong></a>, and <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2977-1.html"><strong>Bioweapons</strong></a> are currently considered risk vectors in all published safety frameworks.</li>
                            <li>This process requires judgment calls, and will vary depending on your organization.</li>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>We recommend taking into account existing practices as well as feedback from leadership, employees, and the public.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>Risk vectors are specific mechanisms by which AI systems could cause harm, and include both deliberate malicious action as well as unintended consequences. Each risk vector may require a unique approach to assessment, monitoring, and mitigation.</p>

                <p>While examining additional risk vectors can reduce the risk of a model causing harm, it also increases costs – requiring additional evaluations (including potentially <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11986">more complex evaluations</a>), more mitigation steps, and a potential risk of delaying or stopping deployment. If your organization wants to consider a broader set of harms than are listed here, we recommend looking at the <a href="https://airisk.mit.edu/">AI Risk Repository</a>, which attempts to catalog many more AI harms.</p>

                        <li>Describe the type of evaluation that will be used to assess the risk of an AI system. Some examples:
                            <ol>
                                <li>For <strong>Model Theft</strong>: Red-teaming can be a way to judge security measures effectively.</li>
                                <li>For <strong>Bioweapons</strong>: Typical evaluations judge whether an AI system is better than a search engine at aiding:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Amateurs in producing known pathogens.</li>
                                        <li>Expert in producing novel pathogens.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li>For <strong>Cyber Offense</strong>: Capture-the-flag challenges are often used to estimate a system's cyberoffensive capabilities.</li>
                                <li>Justify how each assessment is relevant to real-world outcomes.
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>For example: if <strong>Cyber Offense</strong> evaluations are developed with experts to mimic real-world codebases not in the training data, an AI system's performance on the assessment represents real hacking capability.</li>
                                        <li>To ensure external validity and prevent "teaching to the test", perhaps detailed information on what is assessed should be limited even within a given organization.</li>

                                </li>
                                <li>Options exist for non-capability-based evaluations for certain risk domains. For example:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Scaling law analyses might be used to predict how <strong>Model Autonomy</strong> will increase without actually testing models.
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>However, this method may not be useful for judging <strong>Bioweapons</strong> risks, since narrow AI systems can still aid in dangerous tasks.</li>
                                            </ol>

                                        <li>Analyses of the training data to detect presence of examples of dangerous capabilities could be used to filter out <strong>Bioweapons</strong>-relevant data.</li>
                                        <li>Forecasting of future capabilities can also be used to predict AI system capabilities, as mentioned in OpenAI's Preparedness Framework.</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>Describe how this type of evaluation can give information about how close to a risk threshold a given AI model is. This is required in Commitment 2.
                            <ol>
                                <li>For instance: in <strong>Cyber Offense</strong>, capture-the-flag challenges are often rated by difficulty. Completing more advanced challenges can signal that a model is approaching a risk threshold.</li>
                                <li>In Anthropic's RSP v1, <em>fraction</em> of tasks completed in a given evaluation domain area is also taken as an indicator of growing model capabilities.</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>Provide any additional details on how the evaluations will be run. For instance:

                                <li>Which capability elicitation techniques will be used.

                                        <li>Fine-tuning, agent scaffolding, external tools, etc.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                <li>Which mitigations will be in-place, and how will they be tested against?
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Will base models be tested, or only instruction-tuned/RL-tuned?</li>
                                        <li>If, e.g. refusals are being used, how will evaluation prompts be picked? Can they be adversarially tuned?</li>

                                <li><strong>Threat model mapping:</strong> For each capability threshold, make a compelling case that we have mapped out the most likely and consequential threat models: combinations of actors (if relevant), attack pathways, model capability bottlenecks, and types of harms. We also make a compelling case that there does not exist a threat model that we are not evaluating that represents a substantial amount of risk.</li>
                                <li><strong>Evaluations:</strong> Design and run empirical tests that provide strong evidence that the model does not have the requisite skills; explain why the tests yielded such results; and check at test time that the results are attributable to the model’s capabilities rather than issues with the test design. Findings from partner organizations and external evaluations of our models (or similar models) should also be incorporated into the final assessment, when available.</li>
                                <li><strong>Elicitation:</strong> Demonstrate that, when given enough resources to extrapolate to realistic attackers, researchers cannot elicit sufficiently useful results from the model on the relevant tasks. We should assume that jailbreaks and model weight theft are possibilities, and therefore perform testing on models without safety mechanisms (such as harmlessness training) that could obscure these capabilities. We will also consider the possible performance increase from using resources that a realistic attacker would have access to, such as scaffolding, finetuning, and expert prompting. At minimum, we will perform basic finetuning for instruction following, tool use, minimizing refusal rates.</li>
                                <li><strong>Forecasting:</strong> Make informal forecasts about the likelihood that further training and elicitation will improve test results between the time of testing and the next expected round of comprehensive testing."</li>

                                <li>The model is notably more performant on automated tests in risk-relevant domains (defined as 4x or more in Effective Compute)<sup>4</sup>.</li>

                            <p><sup>4</sup>'Effective Compute' is a scaling-trend-based metric that accounts for both FLOPs and algorithmic improvements. An Effective Compute increase of K represents a performance improvement from a pretrained model on relevant task(s) equivalent to scaling up the baseline model's training compute by a factor of K. We plan to track Effective Compute during pretraining on a weighted aggregation of datasets relevant to our Capability Thresholds (e.g., coding and science).

                               <li>For <strong>Model Theft</strong>, the risk might be intolerable if an adversary could exfiltrate a given model's weights with an attack that costs <10% of the model's training cost.
                                   <ol>

                               <li>For <strong>Cyber Offense</strong>, the risk might be intolerable if the model could identify a zero-day and take control of a given arbitrary EC2 instance.</li>
                               <li>For <strong>Bioweapons</strong>, the risk might be intolerable if the model would enable a PhD-level expert to synthesize a pandemic-potential pathogen with less than $100,000.</li>
                               <li>These risk-thresholds might need to be set based on the intended deployment modality. The risks associated with serving an API of a base model might be different than the risks associated with offering fine-tuning.</li>

                       <li>For each justification above, describe in moderate detail the corresponding scenario where, if the threshold is exceeded and the risk isn't mitigated, intolerable harms can occur.</li>
                       <li>Optionally, set additional thresholds as necessary to ensure that AI systems are safely developed and deployed. These may not need to be fully fleshed out as the intolerable risk thresholds above. For example:

                               <li>If some mitigations are expensive to apply, at which threshold will they start coming into practice?</li>
                               <li>Since safety mitigations such as refusals can be nearly-trivially removed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00117">adversarial fine-tuning</a>, thresholds based on the model's performance before safety mitigations may be useful to address threat models such as <strong>Model Theft</strong>.</li>

                            <p><strong>"Low:</strong> Model assistance for cyberattacks, if any, is meaningful only for non-programming uses, e.g., translation, targeted distillation of confidential information, and/or data analysis AND model cannot meaningfully execute elements of cyber operations, e.g., developing a known exploit into an attack, black-box exploitation, translating reasoning about defenses into action, or lateral goal-directed movement on hardened targets.</p>
                            <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Non-programming tasks represent a sizable bottleneck for threat actors; however, the skills involved are not terribly specialized and the benefit comes often from intersectional skills (i.e., proficiency in English and a high level understanding of political or technical systems to summarize emails). We exclude vulnerability discovery because the harm at this stage is not identification of individual vulnerabilities, but moreso the implementation and deployment of an exploit against a target.</p>

                            <p><strong>Critical:</strong> Tool-augmented model can identify and develop functional zero-day exploits of all severity levels, across all software projects, without human intervention OR model can devise and execute end-to-end novel strategies for cyberattacks against hardened targets given only a high level desired goal.</p>
                            <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Finding and executing end-to-end exploits for all software would lead to catastrophe from unilateral actors, from hacking military or industrial systems as well as OpenAI infrastructure. Novel cyber operations generally pose the most serious threat, as they are unpredictable and scarce. They may involve, e.g., novel zero-days or methods of command-and-control."</p>

Identified measures will be evaluated for feasibility and marginal value before being implemented.</p>
                            <p>For safety-related mitigations, we start from a standard set of safety-mitigations:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Reinforcement learning to refuse to generate harmful content.</li>
                                <li>Smaller/less capable input filters that scan incoming requests to flag those that are likely to induce harmful content.</li>
                                <li>Similar output filters that scan model outputs to flag those that are potentially harmful.</li>
                                <li>Public reporting, so that model users can report places where our defenses fail.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>We then follow a similar procedure as with security: any member of the safety team may propose additional mitigations, a subset of team-members will be tasked with keeping up with developments in the field, and any identified measures will be evaluated for feasibility and value before implementation.</p>
                            <p>All mitigations will be implemented by the corresponding team. Security assessments will be unit-tested to the extent possible, and safety mitigations will be verified to be working on toy models with at least 1/100th the parameter count of the model they are intended to be deployed on.</p>
                            <p>Risk assessment details will not be shared with members of risk-mitigation teams, to ensure validity of assessments. Mitigations will be evaluated by whether they effectively cause risk assessment results to drop below pre-defined risk thresholds.</p>
